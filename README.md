# Artificial_Neural_networks_Python
Predicting the churn probability of a customer in a bank based on his demographics and past transactions using Keras which uses Theano and Tensor flow libraries of python.
Theano and Tensor flows are libraries used for numerical computations.(We can use CPU or GPU for numerical compuations. For normal computations CPU is usually used , GPU can be used for complex computations invloving many layers of neural networks)
